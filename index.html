        <h3>Learn. Think. Create. My Design Process.</h3>
        <p>I'm Anne - Freelance Web Designer with a Design/Fitness/Retail background. Careerwise, I have worn many hats, but about three years ago I became intensely interested in mobile &amp; web application design. I focused on templateless web design using simple typography, layouts, and graphics as seen here. With my experience, I know how to solve real business cases by using design thinking. This site uses the scroll magic.js library for it's presentation.</p>
